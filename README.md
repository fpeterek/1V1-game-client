# 1V1-game-client
Client for a 1v1 game

---

Client for a 1v1 neckbeard game written in C++. Don't ever use it, unless your life depends on it.

Easiest way to install this is to download buildable.zip, unzip it and run build.sh.
Make sure you have SFML installed on your computer.
If not, you can use 
  * sudo apt install libsfml-dev (Linux distributions that use apt) 
  * brew install sfml (macOS)

to download the required libraries.

All pixelart is mine. Feel free to use it for non-commercial uses. No one would buy games with my pixelart anyway.

The font isn't mine.
